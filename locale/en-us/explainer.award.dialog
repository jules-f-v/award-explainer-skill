I'm surprised you don't know this seeing as you are my employer! awards are legal documents. they set out the minimum pay and conditions for different types of employment in australia. there are more than 100 different award. each different award covers the working conditions for different industries or occupations. i work effectively as a clerk in the private sector and so i am covered by the clerks private sector award.
It is a bit of a worry that you do not know what an award is. you are supposed to be my employer. i'm no lawyer but basically they are legal documents that set out the minimum pay and conditions for different types of employment in australia. different awards apply to different types of work and industries. you should probably find out whatknow.
